<h1> Worms </h1>



<h3>A worm virus refers to a malicious program that replicates itself, automatically spreading through a network. In this definition of computer worms, the worm virus exploits vulnerabilities in your security software to steal sensitive information, install backdoors that can be used to access the system, corrupt files, and do other kinds of harm.</h3>

Worms consume large volumes of memory, as well as bandwidth. This results in servers, individual systems, and networks getting overloaded and malfunctioning. A worm is different from a virus, however, because a worm can operate on its own while a virus needs a host computer.
